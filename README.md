# Calabi-Yau metrics with JAX
**CYJAX** is a python library for numerically approximating Calabi-Yau metrics
using machine learning implemented with the [JAX library](https://github.com/google/jax).
It is meant to be accessible both on a top-level and in a modular way, exposing all intermediate lower-level functionality.
The principle application is machine learning for the algebraic ansatz of the K채hler potential from [Donaldson's algorithm](https://doi.org/10.4310/jdg/1090349449).
While this ansatz more restrictive compared to approximating the metric directly, it automatically satisfies K채hlerity and compatibility on patch overlaps.
As of now, this implementation is limited to varieties defined by a single defining equation on one complex projective space.
A generalization to a wider class of cases is planned.

Good places to start are the introduction and the tutorial notebooks on the documentation page.
More background can also be found in this [paper](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1835403).
Some background knowledge on [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) may be useful.
The networks implemented here use [Flax](https://github.com/google/flax), but any machine learning framework that works with JAX can be used.

Configurable examples of training for the Dwork family and a two-parameter quintic can be found in the `scripts/` folder.
The configuration files use [hydra](https://hydra.cc) and can be used to change the training target, the training routine, and the network architecture.
While the code runs on both CPU and GPU (if JAX is installed to support this), the latter is advisable for large models.

# Installation
Installation is easiest using [pip](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/key_projects/#pip).
From within the root folder of this repository, run `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools` followed by `pip install .` to install the package.
If you intend to modify the code for development, use `pip install -e .` instead.
If a specific version of [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) is required, e.g. with GPU support, first follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/google/jax#installation).

To run the scripts, additionally [hydra](https://hydra.cc) is required (`pip install --upgrade hydra-core`).

## Building the documentation
This project uses [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) to generate the documentation.
Following the installation of the `cyjax` package, install the additional requirements in `docs/requirements.txt`
(`pip install -r requirements-docs.txt`).
Inside the `docs` folder, run `make html` to generate the html version of the documentation, which can afterwards
be found in `docs/build/html`.

# Related work
Another library with a similar goal as this one is [CYMetric](https://github.com/pythoncymetric/cymetric) .
In contrast to CYMetric, here the algebraic ansatz for the K채hler potential from [Donaldson's algorithm](https://doi.org/10.4310/jdg/1090349449) is used.
While this ansatz is more restrictive, it automatically satisfies K채hlerity and compatibility on patch overlaps.
